# My Setup

Currently I am using a MacBook Pro from 2016 and the binaries are compiled on Linux thats why I use a Kali Linux Docker Container.

**Kali Linux**
I like to use a Docker Container to run Kali, where you basically get a Kali Linux Terminal to work on, because Virtual Machines's tend to be slow on my Mac and I'm used to the Terminal but VM's should do the job too.
